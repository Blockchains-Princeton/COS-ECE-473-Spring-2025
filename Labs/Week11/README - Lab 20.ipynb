    "Validator **restaking** refers to the reuse of the same blockchain validators (and their staked collateral) across multiple services or protocols. In a restaking network, a set of validators that secure a base blockchain (like Ethereum) can simultaneously validate additional services (such as side-chains, oracles, or other decentralized applications). This promises enhanced utility from existing staked assets, but it also introduces new risks. The obvious danger is that sharing validators among many services increases the incentives and opportunities for a validator to deviate from honest behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these risks, robust restaking networks employ **overcollateralization** as a security buffer. Overcollateralization means validators must stake significantly more value than the maximum profit an attacker could gain from corrupting the services they support. We denote the **overcollateralization factor** by γ (gamma). Formally, the condition for robust security is that for any subset of validators and the set of services they could jointly corrupt, the total stake at risk is at least a factor (1 + γ) larger than the total profit from attacking those services. This buffer ensures that any successful attack would cost the attackers more (in slashed stake) than they stand to gain, disincentivizing such attacks.\n",
